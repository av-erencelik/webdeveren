# webdeveren with Next.js, Sanity.io CMS, and TypeScript

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, Sanity.io CMS, and TypeScript.

## About

My portfolio website is a showcase of my skills, projects, and experience. It features a blog section where I write about various topics related to web development and design.

The website is built with Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering, and Sanity.io CMS, a headless CMS that enables me to easily manage my blog content.

I also used the following libraries:

- Framer Motion for animations
- i18next for internationalization support
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

The website is written in TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability.

## Installation

To install the website locally, clone this repository and run the following commands:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Feel free to use this repository as a template for your own portfolio website. You can customize the content, design, and functionality to suit your needs.
